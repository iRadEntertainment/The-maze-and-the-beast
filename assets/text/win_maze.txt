The Beast, sated to the brink of bursting, has reluctantly let you free. Now, you find yourself thrust back into the very society that cast you into the labyrinth. Life outside feels bleak, mirroring the dark corners of the maze. Yet, having survived the beast and its trials, you are imbued with a newfound resilience.

No regrets shadow your past deeds, nor does fear of the maze linger in your heart. You are certain your path will lead you back to those twisting corridors.

Redeem yourselfâ€”before time runs out!
